    <para id="delete_me">You have a laptop or desktop computer that uses the Windows operating system, any one from Windows 98 to NT to 2000 to XP. You already have Wordcorr installed on your computer, but now it is time to upgrade it to a new release. (If you <emphasis>don't</emphasis> have Wordcorr installed, click <link document="m13436">here</link> to find out how to install it the first time.)</para><para id="element-516">Make sure you have current backup files exported for every collection that is already in Wordcorr on your computer. Then go ahead with the upgrade.</para><para id="element-787">The current Wordcorr upgrade (2.0.0) applies to any Wordcorr release 1.3.7 or after. <note type="Earlier Releases" id="idm423712"><label>Earlier Releases</label>For earlier releases, the internal database structure is a little different. Make sure you have all your collections backed up. Then do Start, Search, Files and Folders, and search for ".wordcorr" (that's DOTwordcorr, and leave off the quotation marks). Click on that folder to open it, and delete the files in it, but don't delete the folder. Then when you finish the upgrade, Wordcorr will recreate its internal database in the correct form. For releases 1.3.7 or later, you don't need to clear the .wordcorr folder.</note></para><para id="element-628">What kind of Internet connection are you using? The Wordcorr upgrade is 7.1 megabytes, smaller than the full installation. It can still take a long time to download if all you have is a dial-up telephone connection through a modem.</para><para id="element-169">If you have any way of connecting to the Internet through a broadband connection, use that for the upgrade. Once Wordcorr is upgraded, however, you can use it without broadband. Broadband connections come through cable television companies, a DSL link provided by your telephone company, or a direct arrangement often found in universities and corporate offices. Internet cafes don't usually have broadband.</para><para id="element-898"><note type="Tip" id="idp3167808"><label>Tip</label>If you can't work out a broadband arrangement, find someone who has one. Ask them to download the Wordcorr upgrade for you, but instead of installing it on their computer, transfer it to a CD-ROM so that you can install it from there. (If you can't read a CD-ROM, your computer's capacity may be too small to handle Wordcorr; maybe it's time to change computers.)</note></para><para id="element-616">When you click on Download at the very end of this module, it takes you to the place on the Internet where you can always find the latest version of the upgrade. It's a Web site called SourceForge.net that is the distribution point for millions of downloads. SourceForge confirms that you are downloading Release 2.0.0 for upgrade, and shows you a list of <term>mirror</term> Web sites around the world that you can download from. Pick one reasonably near you and click on the "Download" link to its right.</para><para id="element-881">A "File Download" box will come up and ask if you want to open the file being downloaded, or save it. Choose "Open". <note type="Tip" id="idm7008800"><label>Tip</label>If someone else is downloading for you, tell them to choose "Save". That will put the file on their disk, where they can put it on a CD-ROM for you. To load it from a CD-ROM, bring up the directory that contains wordcorr-2-0-0-upgrade.exe and double click on the file name.</note></para><para id="element-939">From that point on, you're on familiar territory. The file contains an installer, which offers to put Wordcorr in C:\Program Files\Wordcorr for you. Accept the offer, and any others that it makes. It also puts some files with internal configuration information in the special .wordcorr folder if you have deleted the ones that were there. It does not set up a new copy of the Java Runtime Environment, because it knows how to find the one you already have.</para><para id="element-788">Got all that? Good! Now here goes:
